 CephFS mostly assumes a controlled environment where clients are not restricted
 in what paths they are allowed to mount. And if they do mount a subdirectory,
-e.g., /home/user, the MDS does not currently verify that subsequent operations
+e.g., /home/user, the MDS by default verify that subsequent operations
 are ‘locked’ within that directory. Path-based restriction allows us to restrict
 a client to a particular directory in the file system.
 
 Syntax
 ======
+To mount with the kernel client we follow the undermentioned syntax. ::
+
+mount -t ceph *mon ip*:*/path* mnt -o name=*client_name*,secret=*key*
+
+for example, to mount kernel client name ``foo`` with ip ``123.456.789.012`` and key
+``AQD4XddVUrQTGRAA4CEWIizqd1g8tKiDWyqOSw==`` to path ``/home/foo``, we will use. ::
+
+mount -t ceph 123.456.789.012:/home/foo mnt -o name=foo,secret=AQD4XddVUrQTGRAA4CEWIizqd1g8tKiDWyqOSw==
+
 
 To grant rw access to the specified directory only, we mention the specified
 directory while creating key for a client following the undermentioned syntax. ::
 
-./ceph auth get-or-create client.*client_name* mon 'allow r' mds 'allow r, allow rw path=/*specified_directory*' osd 'allow rwx'
+ceph auth get-or-create client.*client_name* mon 'allow r' mds 'allow rw path=/*specified_directory*' osd 'allow rwx'
 
 for example, to restrict client ``foo`` to ``bar`` directory, we will use. ::
 
-./ceph auth get-or-create client.foo mon 'allow r' mds 'allow r, allow rw path=/bar' osd 'allow rwx'
+ceph auth get-or-create client.foo mon 'allow r' mds 'allow rw path=/bar' osd 'allow rwx'
 
 
 To restrict a client to the specfied sub-directory only, we mention the specified
 directory while mounting following the undermentioned syntax. ::
 
-./ceph-fuse -n client.*client_name* *mount_path* -r *directory_to_be_mounted*
+ceph-fuse -n client.*client_name* *mount_path* -r *directory_to_be_mounted*
 
 for example, to restrict client ``foo`` to ``mnt/bar`` directory, we will use. ::
 
-./ceph-fuse -n client.foo mnt -r /bar
+ceph-fuse -n client.foo mnt -r /bar
